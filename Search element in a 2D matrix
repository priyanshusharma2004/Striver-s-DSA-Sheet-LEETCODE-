You are given a 2-D matrix of dimensions 'N' x 'M', each row of the matrix is sorted in non-decreasing order, and each column is sorted in non-decreasing order.
You are also given an integer ‘X’. You are supposed to find whether 'X' is present in the given matrix.
Constraints :
1 <= X <= 10^6
1 <= N,M <= 100
-10^6 <= ARR[i][j] <= 10^6
Where ARR[i][j] denotes the jth element of the i’th row of the given matrix.
Time Limit: 1 sec


def findInMatrix(target, grid):
    m=len(grid)
    n=len(grid[0])
    start=0
    end=m*n-1
    while start<=end:
        mid=start+(end-start)//2
        row=mid//n
        col=mid%n
        element=grid[row][col]
        if element==target:
            return True
        if element<target:
            start=mid+1
        else:
            end=mid-1
    return False
